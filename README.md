# US-census-analysis

Analyzed data from the 2019 US census, focusing on population patterns. SQL queries were performed to discover insights on the way the population was distributed across counties and states, and on growth rates across counties and states. 

Created correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables (land area, 2010 population size, 2010 population density, percent growth 2010-2019, population increase 2010-2019). Maps depicting population change and percent population growth were created to visually depict population distribution and trends across the United States.
